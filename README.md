# Image Processing TEAM SBT (group 11)

## Section 1: Software and Platform Used

### Software:

**Python**: This is the primary programming language used for this project.

**TensorFlow**: This software library was used to support the neural network models we build for data analysis.

**Google Colab**: The cloud-based platform used for running Jupyter notebooks, particularly for data cleaning.

**Rivanna**: This UVA based high performance system platform enabled us to have suffiecent memory to run download our image data and conduct analysis on it to build our model. More information can be found here: https://www.rc.virginia.edu/userinfo/hpc/


### Add-on Packages:

**Matplotlib** 
**Tensorflow**
**tensorflow_datasets**
**Counter**
**Random**



### Platform:
- **Mac** and **Windows**: These operating systems were used during development.
